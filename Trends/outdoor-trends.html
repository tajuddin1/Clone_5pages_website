                    Emerging from the colder temperatures of a wintery season, days spent in the beckoning fresh air and sunshine are a welcome change of pace. Looking at this year’s trends, the outdoor living canvas should fit the design sensibilities of the home, creating a seamless transition from the walls to the patio to the back reaches of the yard, emitting a perfect environment for dining, entertaining, playing, or just relaxing.
                    <br> <br>
                    According to the Home Improvement Outlook Survey from Axiom, approximately 67 percent of homeowners will spend more time on outdoor home improvement projects than the previous year.
                    <br><br>
                    HomeLight’s Buyer and Seller Insights notes that 26 percent of buyers stated a desire to have an outdoor space drive their decision to purchase a home, as well as 39 percent of homeowners having plans to renovate their outdoor areas within the next five years. This illustrates that outdoor living is on the minds of home buyers and home owners alike.

                        <strong>Merging the Indoors with the Outdoors</strong>
                        The border between indoor and outdoor living slowly dissolves the moment the swinging doors open and offer a seamless portal to comfort. Breaking these limits requires rethinking what a home can be.
                        <br><br>
                        With a focus this year on merging the indoors and outdoors, look for more use of folding glass doors opening onto furnished patios, enclosed verandas, or partially covered gardens. There will be ample windows or retractable walls that elevate the design while blending its existence with the patio.
                        <br><br>
                        Integrating these two spaces is not confined to a glass-based transition; it also can mean infusing pendant or string lighting that helps create the feeling of a ceiling. Other structures, such as awnings, pergolas, or decorative screen panels allow for privacy and use when the weather turns wet. Shade and lighting promote the same level of coziness and charm that the indoors provides, making it a must on a remodel list.

                        <strong>Itching for a Kitchen</strong>
                        The idea of cooking outdoors is enticing. The cornucopia of products available – cooktops or grills, cabinets, cabinet hardware, countertops, faucets, sinks, and seating – are available in a variety of colors, textures, and designs.
                        <br><br>
                        The appeal may be too much to pass up. The Remodeling Impact Report: Outdoor Features, issued by the National Association of Realtors Research Group, found 34 percent of landscaping professionals saw an increase in outdoor kitchen projects versus the previous year. It also found a 100 percent cost recovery for these investments.
                        <br><br>
                        Creating and utilizing an outdoor kitchen can promote a happier, more enjoyable experience year-round. That may be why duplicating one of the most utilized rooms in the glow of Mother Nature is sizzling in popularity.

                        <strong>Carving a Path</strong>
                        There is movement toward more paver walkways appearing in backyards, and with good reason. Bypassing the boredom of a concrete sidewalk, these paths ooze eye appeal. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the case of natural stone pavers, it can be the perfect pairing of serenity with sustainability. They offer several delectable material options, such as the subtle beauty of limestone, the rustic expression of slate, the earthy look of travertine, and the elegance of marble. Those pivoting toward porcelain pavers discover choices that replicate the appearance of wood, concrete, and stone.
                        <br><br>
                        Any choice results in a low-maintenance path that converts the blank slate of the yard into a space with added interest and pleasant functionality. The trend of pavers lends the ideal solution for the aesthetic and nature of a design.

                        <strong>Merging the Indoors with the Outdoors</strong>
                        Since the days of the pandemic, homeowners have yearned to create a sense of being on vacation within the confines of the backyard. Even though travel has begun a resurgence, escaping just outside the door remains popular.
                        <br><br>
                        Upscale relaxation in the outdoors encompasses outdoor kitchens, area rugs, high-quality furniture, pizza ovens, elaborate firepits, and water features. Adding one or more of these swanky features can evoke a calming, hotel-like environment.
                        <br><br>
                        According to the Remodeling Impact Report: Outdoor Features, from the National Association of Realtors Research Group, 69 percent of homeowners experience an increase in enjoyment after an outdoor remodel. The report also noted that elevating a backyard space for relaxation can increase the return on investment as, not surprisingly, 97 percent of realtors find curb appeal, even if behind the home, matters to buyers.

                        Incorporating different materials in an outdoor project may not seem like a new concept, but it continues to trend upward. This approach embraces eclectic design schemes, sparking copious amounts of visual intrigue.
                        <br><br>
                        Pairing typical outdoor mainstays – wood, metal, and glass – can enhance a yard’s look and feel. Marrying other materials is also gaining momentum, including composite, concrete, aluminum, wicker, stone, and copper. Mixing and matching two or more makes for new opportunities to highlight creativity within an outdoor living area.
                        <br><br>
                        Use of varying colors and patterns is also being embraced, creating a subtle complement or bold contrast. This aids with generating interest and adding a fresh perspective to the outdoor canvas.

                        <strong>Sustainability Matters</strong>
                        Perhaps influenced by being in the realm of Mother Nature, opting for sustainable products for outdoor living is a rising trend. Homeowners are seeking spaces that encourage a balanced, healthy lifestyle and are diverse enough to meet their needs, while also being environmentally friendly.
                        <br><br>
                        When the playing field is level between product choices, sustainably-sourced goods – those made with recycled materials, or providing energy-saving or water-saving initiatives – are often becoming the tie-breaker.
                        <br><br>
                        When choosing products like composite decking, made primarily from recycled and reclaimed materials, or furniture that utilizes bamboo, recycled plastics, rattan, or other environmentally-friendly materials, a more sustainable lifestyle can be fostered without compromising on design.

                        Taking a shower is an attractive thought after time spent performing yard maintenance, gathering vegetables from a garden, or swimming in the pool. More and more, homeowners are wanting to clean themselves in the glow of the sun.
                        <br><br>
                        The appeal of outdoor showers is increasing in popularity. Influencers of this trend include outdoor tile options, such as intricate mosaics, large format wood-looks, and earth-toned natural stone. Couple this with an array of shower head styles, including rain head versions that seem quite appropriate to be used in the elements.
                        <br><br>
                        Outdoor showers are making their presence known in backyards. By bringing this typical indoor feature into the elements of nature, an envious oasis is forged.

                        Dedicating space for working from home became a necessity during the pandemic; however, along with it came the evolution of what this function could be. As a large number of homeowners continue to work remote, the growing trend is moving this function into the outdoors.
                        <br><br>
                        Having a dedicated zone on the patio or deck, or in the garden, enables a tranquil ambiance for completing work. Stylish seating and decorative area rugs help create a comfortable outdoor office. Ceiling fans or heaters can be used to regulate the temperature, while awnings, umbrellas, and pergolas add shade… making laptop screens easier to see.
                        <br><br>
                        Partaking of these work-from-home spaces may necessitate accessories, such as paper weights or noise-canceling headphones, providing the opportunity to take full advantage of the welcoming outdoors more often.
