                    <strong>Arches and Curves</strong>
                    When making a bold move in a room design, something that draws the eye may be necessary, in order to embody the support and strength that it takes to make such a change. Symbolizing that strength is the archway, which can accentuate the oasis of the bathtub or center the family around the hearth of the fireplace. It also offers support above doorways and windows, as well as aesthetic support in mirrors, wallpaper, and other wall art.
                    <br> <br>
                    Curvature is being built into other mainstays of the home. Arch-style kitchen cabinets feature curved edges, while circular shelves within the storage accentuate the style of 2023. Curved kitchen islands, bars, and seating allow for more entertaining. In living areas, furniture pieces like the accent chair and sofa are beginning to curve, bringing families closer during movie or game night.

                    <strong>A Transition to Maximalism</strong>
                    Bid farewell to the days when less was more. Today’s modern home makes daring design choices with their décor. Stunning options like rich fabrics and luxurious textures are only met with the poignant layered patterning and deep, jewel tones that maximalism offers.
                    <br> <br>
                    Bringing the room together are warm brass and gold accent pieces. In living rooms, look to mirrors and wall art. In a kitchen, such hardware can make the cabinetry pop, replacing monochromatic black. This is making rooms flourish alongside gold-accented wallpaper and elegant wall sconces that boast a playful prominence in in 2023.

                    <strong>The Evolving Laundry Room</strong>
                    Gone are the perceptions of the dark, derelict laundry room found deep in the trenches of an unfinished basement. In 2023, this cleaning space is in the symphony of daring style choices, giving new life to this area of the home.
                    <br> <br>
                    Decorated with design-centric backsplashes and artisanal floating shelves, the laundry room has been rethought of as a space to do more than wash and hang clothing. It has evolved into a room to admire, similar to other areas of the home. Creating that space requires the boldness that 2023 provides. With durable and decorative floor choices meeting the bold décor along the walls, the laundry room has been reclaimed by the home.

                    If the trendy move of 2023 is letting décor of the home pop, then carpet is the choice trend for making bedrooms embrace this movement. Never substituting comfort for style, carpet fosters an aura of tranquility and oasis with its naturally restorative textures and fibers.

                    The feelings emanated from carpet creates a aura of retreat. With its palette of organic tones, warm neutrals, pastel greens, and golden shades, homeowners can set out for that perfect night of sleep and relaxation.
