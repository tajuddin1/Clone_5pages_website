                    From wood cabinets with lasting appeal to walk-in showers that make the oasis real, the hottest kitchen and bathroom trends of 2023 are about building every comfort into the confines of the two most frequently used rooms in the home, with designs that can stand the test of time.
                    <br> <br>
                    With homeowners spending more time in the home, these trends reflect the idea of setting it and forgetting it: creating the ideal design with amenities and classically beautiful elements in kitchens and bathrooms. ProSource Wholesale® is proud to highlight these inspiring trends that continue the tradition of adding fashion and function to the home.

                        One of the most noticeable trends applies to all project scopes and, ironically, aligns with the perks of partnership with ProSource®.
                        <br> <br>
                        Looking back during much of the run of the pandemic, do-it-yourself projects skyrocketed. With people confined to their home, countless homeowners realized that they wanted, or even needed, to make their space more comfortable or functional.
                        <br><br>
                        Flash forward, and the approach to remodeling has shifted. No longer feeling compelled to go solo, the majority or homeowners are relying on the expertise and craftsmanship of trade professionals, such as builders, contractors, designers, installers, and remodelers.
                        <br><br>
                        By relying on the skill and experience of a vetted pro (like the members of ProSource), homeowners are finding enhanced results, creating the ideal versions of their kitchens, bathrooms, and… basically every room.

                        The kitchen is a finite space, but the idea of opening up the area and creating a seamless transition to other parts of the home continues its upward trend in 2023. Kitchen designs have begun accounting for a pantry, mudroom, dining room, and powder room, as well as any living area that may be connected with an open floor plan. Many remodeling undertakings are seeking more connectivity between the indoor and outdoor, allowing for seasonal outdoor gatherings or year-round entertaining in appropriate climates.

Wood cabinets are increasing in popularity, with medium and dark tones being added the most (not that light versions are being ignored). Although color, especially white, maintains its presence, more kitchens are retreating from glossy varnish and heavy stains, returning to the embrace of natural wood grain and tone.

                        Minimal design elements found in flat-panel (i.e., slab) cabinet doors and drawers are gaining popularity year-over year, giving homeowners the opportunity of riding the wave of this classic craze. Although shaker style cabinets still hold the top spot for kitchens, the sleek appearance of flat-panel cabinets are on the rise. Kitchens which embrace this trend showcase a minimalist personality in the space.

                        New cabinets pose a demand for hardware that levels up their functionality, making storage a breeze. Bar pulls are the popular choice, allowing for easy access to those required cooking accessories. Also, the blending of different metals – brass, bronze, chrome, nickel, stainless steel, and more – is gaining momentum. Integrating cabinet hardware into drawers and doors adds sophistication, giving a rich, inviting appearance. It is the finishing touch to the kitchen design.

                        In 2023, the bold patterns and dark hues of previous countertops give way to lighter colors. This trend creates an attractive glow in order to provide a complement to the wood cabinetry. Subdued countertops sport soft-muted shades and honed finishes without the busy designs of the past. Quartz, quartzite, and the newer emerging sintered stone are the surfaces to watch when considering these lighter shades. Their non-porous, stain-resistant, and low maintenance characteristics aide their appeal.

                        <strong>Walk-in Showers and Bathtubs</strong>
                        For those seeking that sample of an oasis within the comfort of the home, it often presents itself in the form of a walk-in shower. As has been the case for a few years, showers are being upgraded to include expanded sizes (two-person options are preferred), shower seats, and multiple shower heads (especially rain shower heads), along with zero-entry showers for ageless accessibility or special needs. The larger area and enhanced features provide a spa-like retreat.
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, the alcove bathtub is losing ground. That space is being reclaimed for the aforementioned shower enlargement or perhaps linen storage. However, often it is replaced by a freestanding version. The beauty of these tubs is accentuated by their ability to add character and relaxation. The reconfigured, more open, bathroom fosters an air of tranquility.

                        The trend of natural wood cabinets in the kitchen is carrying forth into the bathroom with vanities. Bathrooms have been dominated by painted finishes on the vanity. White has been especially prevalent; however, natural wood is gaining popularity. With a variety of species and tones available, wood vanities allow for a customized approach. Plus, the wood look complements the modern organic style and warm colors which moved into bathrooms previously.

                        <strong>Tile Becomes Personal</strong>
                        Tile is popular in bathrooms because it can touch so many areas – floor, backsplash, tile base, tub surround, and shower walls; however, a search for 2023 bathroom tile trends produces a varied list. One suggestion is going all in with one or more bold colors, providing playful energy. Another idea recommends earth tones that offer nature-inspired serenity. There are also those who feel light-toned hues, like soft pastels or pale green, will give the bathroom an open feel.
                        <br><br>
                        Recognizing the absence of a clear consensus, at least with color tones, it is creative freedom and personal taste that will drive tile decisions for the coming year.
                        <br><br>
                        Still, one tile trend does seem to be making its presence known. Terrazzo is continuing its impressive comeback in 2023. This material is hyped in bathrooms thanks to its durability and easy maintenance.

                        In 2023, homeowners are opting for quality and comfort, and what’s underfoot in the bathroom is no exception. With a desire to bypass the traditional bathmat, area rugs are gaining popularity as a complementary point of prominence. Nearly any carpet can be bound into a custom area rug, sized for the desired space. Some styles also boast waterproof technology, ideal for a room known for its moisture. This year, adding plush to the bathroom can add a splash of luxury.

This may be found with the vanity, cabinet hardware, or bathroom accessories. For those wishing to be slightly more daring and follow the kitchen trend, mixing metals remains a popular movement. The intent for 2023 is to lean into the fashion of the design vision without compromising functionality.
